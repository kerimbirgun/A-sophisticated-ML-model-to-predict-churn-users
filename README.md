# A-sophisticated-ML-model-to-predict-churn-users

This capstone project was meant to tackle one of world's leading shopper insight company's churn user problem.
For NDA purposes the document shared only features the Python code without any confidential company data.

While establising this model, following analytics efforts are implemented:
- Missing value imputation
- New Feature Extraction with data wrangling (Recency, Frequency, Periodicity)
- Time Series Prediction (Exponential Smoothing)
- Balancing imbalanced classes by downsampling the majority
- Outlier removal
- Feature elimination with regularization
- Predictive Models (XGBoost, Random Forest, ANN)

The result of the model successfully performed with approximately 85% F1 Score, despite the imbalanced class issue in the dataset.
